# Features

What we might build next. New requests go in as they come up, and finished work moves to Done.

## Bugs

- **The background went dark after using macOS's Fill** (another Mac, 29 Oct). Not reproduced.
  Probably Expanse's backdrop holding a copy of the desktop picture taken while macOS had it
  dimmed. Next time: Troubleshooting › Copy Logs for a Bug Report on that Mac.

## Next up

1. **Window size snapping** (asked 28 Oct). Resize so grids of windows come out neat. Today
   Expanse only moves windows; resizing is whatever you do to the real window at 100%.
   - While you resize, edges snap to neighbouring edges and to the standard 20pt gap.
   - Sizes snap to match: the same width as the column, the same height as the row.
   - Maybe: resize handles on the canvas while zoomed out, and a way to even up a row or
     column in one go.
2. **Demo videos for the README.** Recorded in a clean macOS VM, so nothing personal is filmed.
   In progress.
3. **Minimap and Spaces polish**, left over from the UI hill climb:
   - the viewport keeps one accent ring at every zoom level, instead of turning into a grey box;
   - windows in view are drawn stronger than off-screen ones;
   - a press state on Space tiles, with the switch happening on mouse-up;
   - an open-hand cursor over the minimap, and at 100% a click goes to that spot.
4. **Multiple monitor support** (asked again 28 Oct). Today Expanse uses the main display only.
5. **Low-motion mode** (asked 28 Oct): animated screen moves turned off, so glides, zooms and
   centring jump straight to where they end. Probably on by default when macOS's Reduce Motion
   is on (Accessibility › Display), which Expanse doesn't follow yet.

## In progress elsewhere

- **Windows version.** The plan is in [windows-port.md](windows-port.md), built in its own session
  on a UTM VM.
- **Omarchy / Hyprland plugin** (`~/Code/ACTIVE/expanse-hypr`): catching up with the Mac
  features, plus a deep dive on jank.

## Ideas

- Tidy Up lines up bottom and right edges too (today: tops and lefts).
- Demo clips that show the pointer: resting in a corner, clicking a window.

## Won't do

- **Typing into windows while zoomed out.** That needs SIP turned off.
- **Hiding macOS's purple capture badge.** macOS draws it on captured windows; Expanse
  captures as little as it can instead.

## Done

- 0.1.28: Sizes set with macOS's Fill, Moom or a keyboard shortcut stick, and a window that fills
  the screen keeps filling it.
- 0.1.27: New Finder windows open beside you instead of at an old Finder window's spot, and closing
  one keeps the view where it is; refused window scans back off instead of asking every 5s.
- 0.1.26: A stuck capture service (replayd) isn't swamped any more: scans back off, and captures
  wait for it to answer (overnight on 29 Oct, requests piled up in it until the screen froze); an
  app's loading box doesn't take its main window's spot; new windows go upward only as a last
  resort; a window in a column stays lined up after a display change and back.
- 0.1.25: Recovers when macOS restarts its capture service (windows no longer drop off the canvas,
  and new ones are still taken on); an app that opens again gets its windows' spots back; VM
  windows keep their spot when the VM changes resolution; clicking a window you can see keeps a
  view you placed.
- 0.1.24: A window back from full screen keeps its spot, instead of staying where macOS set it
  down.
- 0.1.23: Troubleshooting menu (Detailed Logging, Copy Logs for a Bug Report, Report an Issue);
  the log says why a window drops off the canvas.
- 0.1.22: Display changes keep every window's spot (round trips come back exactly, columns stay
  lined up); window names hidden unless turned on; release builds open at login; the canvas
  never covers another app's dialog.
- 0.1.21: New windows open beside the window they came from; VM and remote-screen apps size their
  own windows; apps that size in steps don't make the layout count as shrunk.
- 0.1.20: Tidy Up lines up each group where it is, and leaves groups in place.
- 0.1.19: Window tabs (Finder, etc.) keep the window's spot.
- 0.1.18: Liquid Glass minimap and Spaces panels, Restore Layout snapshots, layouts fitted
  when a monitor comes or goes, hidden apps' windows remembered across restarts.
